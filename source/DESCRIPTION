Description: A feature selection strategy that selects the best variables of the observation matrix of an experiment with one or multiple conditions by using a hidden Markov model. This strategy can summarize the samples observations or receive a priori information to get a customized model. The multiple condition feature selection strategy depends on the Control/Baseline condition to have a more accurate filtering.
